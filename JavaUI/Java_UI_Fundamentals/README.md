# Java UI Fundamentals: Day 1-3

This repository covers the basics of Java UI development using Swing, focusing on creating GUIs, handling layouts, and implementing basic interactivity. Here’s a breakdown of what we’ll learn over the first three days.

## Day 1: Getting Started with Java Swing

### Goals
- Set up the Java environment and understand the basics of Java GUI development.
- Familiarize yourself with Swing, the primary library for creating Java desktop applications.

### Key Concepts
1. **JFrame**: The main window where components like buttons, labels, and text fields are added.
2. **JLabel**: Displays static text or images on the frame.
3. **JButton**: Adds clickable buttons that can trigger events when clicked.
4. **JTextField**: Provides a single-line text input field.

### Learning Outcome
- Build a simple Java window with interactive components.
- Gain an understanding of how to create a JFrame, add JLabels, JButtons, and JTextFields to the window.

## Day 2: Layout Managers and Basic Event Handling in Swing

### Goals
- Organize UI components effectively using layout managers.
- Add interactivity with basic event handling.

### Key Concepts
1. **Layout Managers**: Control the arrangement of components within containers.
   - **FlowLayout**: Components are arranged in a left-to-right flow.
   - **BorderLayout**: Divides the container into North, South, East, West, and Center regions.
   - **GridLayout**: Arranges components in a grid of rows and columns.
2. **Event Handling**: Captures and handles user actions, such as button clicks.
   - **ActionListener**: Detects and responds to actions like button clicks.

### Learning Outcome
- Understand different layout managers and when to use them.
- Implement basic event handling to make the UI interactive.

## Day 3: Advanced Event Handling and Additional Swing Components

### Goals
- Learn to handle more complex events, such as mouse and keyboard interactions.
- Explore additional Swing components like JPanel, JTextArea, and JCheckBox.

### Key Concepts
1. **JPanel**: A container for organizing components into groups.
2. **JTextArea**: A multiline text input field for entering or displaying longer text.
3. **JCheckBox**: Allows multiple selections with checkboxes.
4. **Mouse and Key Events**:
   - **MouseListener**: Detects and responds to mouse actions like clicks and movement.
   - **KeyListener**: Captures keyboard input and reacts to key events.

### Learning Outcome
- Organize components using JPanel and create interactive forms with JCheckBox and JTextArea.
- Handle advanced events using MouseListener and KeyListener for more dynamic UIs.

## Summary

In these first three days, you’ll gain a solid foundation in Java UI basics, focusing on:
1. Setting up a simple Swing application.
2. Organizing UI components with layout managers.
3. Adding interactivity through basic and advanced event handling.

This prepares you for building more advanced Java desktop applications with custom layouts and interactive elements.

Happy Coding!
